## CodeSpaces within GitHub

GitHub repos can initiate a GitHub Codespace, which is a development environment that runs in the cloud. It is based on Docker and uses Visual Studio Code as the editor.
These used to be free but now require payment.
I have used these in the context of activities with
[Environmental Data Science Innovation & Impact Lab (ESIIL)](https://esiil.org).

**Always stop a codespace when done to save resources!**

## What is `devcontainer.json`?

The `devcontainer.json` file is a configuration file that defines a structured, reproducible development environment inside a Docker container. It serves as the primary configuration file for the Development Container Specification. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Instead of configuring your local operating system, this file tells compatible tools exactly how to spin up a dedicated container equipped with all the specific tools, libraries, runtimes, and editor extensions required to work on a codebase. This entirely eliminates the classic "it works on my machine" problem across development teams. [1, 5, 6, 7]  

### File Location

The file is checked directly into your project's version control (like Git). Supporting tools look for it in one of two places:

- At the root of your project as  
- Inside a dedicated folder as  (Most common) [1, 8]  

### What You Can Configure

The file is formatted as JSON with Comments (JSONC). It allows you to automate the setup of several distinct layers of your workspace:

- The Environment Layer: You can point directly to an existing Docker image, reference a local , or leverage a  file to orchestrate multi-container setups.
- The Tooling Layer ("Features"): You can easily pull in pre-packaged, standardized tools (like the Azure CLI, Go, or Docker-in-Docker) without manually scripting their installation.
- The Editor Layer ("Customizations"): You can force the editor to automatically install specific extensions (e.g., Python linters or Prettier) and inject default workspace settings directly into the container.
- The Network & Automation Layer: You can automate port forwarding so web servers running inside the container are accessible on your host machine, and trigger  scripts to automate tasks like running  or  automatically. [1, 14, 17]  

### Basic Code Example

Here is the `devcontainer.json` file used for the
[ESIIL Stars](https://esiil.org/esiil-stars) program: [14, 15, 17]  

```
{
    "name": "ESIIL Stars Container",
    "image": "registry.hub.docker.com/earthlab/first-map:latest",
    "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces",
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
        // Use black to format code (right click)
        "ms-python.black-formatter",
    ],
    "settings": {
        // Display line length guides
        "editor.rulers": [72, 79],
        // Turn off annoying overzealous autocomplete
        "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
        // Formatting tools
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
        "python.formatting.blackArgs": [
            "--line-length=79",
            "--experimental-string-processing"
        ],        
        // Set the default python to the conda install
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/opt/conda/bin/python"
    },
}
```

### Supporting Tools

While originally created by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code, the format is an open standard utilized by various platforms across the industry:

- IDEs & Editors:  VS Code Dev Containers extension , GitHub Codespaces, and JetBrains IDEs.
- Local Workspace Managers: Open-source tools like DevPod and Coder.
- Automation: The Dev Container CLI which allows you to build, test, and validate these environments within Continuous Integration (CI/CD) pipelines. [3, 7, 8, 18, 23, 24]
