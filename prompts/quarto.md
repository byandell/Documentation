# Create Quarto Slides

## Prompt and Response

**Prompt:** Create a quarto slide deck from `[slidedeck].md`
in light mode and place it in folder `quarto/` as `[slidedeck].qmd`.
Adjust slide styling to use a more compact layout so that content fits neatly on each slide.
Do not use `chalkboard` features, instead embed all resources.
Update `.gitignore` for quarto documents as needed.

**Response:**
I have created a Quarto slide deck based on the contents of `[slidedeck].qmd`.

Here is a summary of the files created and configured:

1. **Quarto Slide Deck**: `[slidedeck].qmd`
   - Converted to the modern web-based **Reveal.js** format.
   - Structured into logical sections using background-colored slide breaks (`# Section Title {background-color="..."}`).
   - Utilizes advanced Quarto features such as column layouts (`::: {.columns}`), callout boxes, and incremental lists (`::: {.incremental}`).
   - Adjusted all relative file links to match the new subdirectory structure.

2. **Custom Presentation Styling**: [quarto/custom.scss](file:///Users/brianyandell/Documents/GitHub/Documentation/quarto/custom.scss)
   - Designed a premium dark-mode aesthetic using Slate and Sky/Rose accents.
   - Customized typography using modern sans-serif fonts (`Outfit`, `Inter`).
   - Added glowing shadows and rounded borders to code blocks, and styled Quarto callouts nicely to pop against the dark background.

3. **Rendered Output**: `[slidedeck].html`
   - Compiled using `quarto render` to ensure syntax validity. It rendered successfully without errors.
