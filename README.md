# Documentation

## Useful Documentation and Tutorials

This repository is a collection of useful documentation and tutorials for various topics, mostly related to code languages and tools.
These were previously dispersed in various GitHub repositories and organizations, and have been consolidated here, with a few exceptions.
My notes on [R](cran.r-project.org) were organized for a short course in the
[UW-Madison Data Science Hub](https://hub.datascience.wisc.edu/), which remain
in their
[UW-Madison-DataScience GitHub Organization](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/)
as the repository
[R_for_data_sciences](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/R_for_data_sciences).

My exploration of earth data science (EDA) is in my GitHub Organization
[byandell-envsys](https://github.com/byandell-envsys).
This journey began with my introduction to the
[Environmental Data Science Innovation & Impact Lab (ESIIL)](https://esiil.org/).
I took some short courses on EDA through ESIIL, which led to my
[geospatial](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/geospatial) package;
with references now migrated here in [geospatial.md](./geospatial.md).
I attended the ESIIL Innovation Summit in 2023 (and every year since),
which introduced me to many amazing people who have become friends.
This was an exciting mix of top-notch IT experts sharing learning and access state-of-the-art tools.
Through ESIIL I have gotten to know a collection of Tribal data scientists
with amazing skills and perspectives on science and the earth.

My learning about environmental systems
spans technical, cultural and environmental spheres.
I have collaborated as part of the
[ESIIL Working Groups](https://esiil.org/working-groups)
for
[Maka Sitomniya (2024-2026)](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/Maka-Sitomniya)
(see
[ESIIL Data Library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/)
and
[datacube/notebooks](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/Maka-Sitomniya/tree/main/datacube/notebooks))
and
[Three Rivers (2025)](https://cu-esiil.github.io/resilience-rare-hydrologic-events-management-innovation-summit-2025__15/).

I began attending the Friday noon meetings of the
[Oglala Lakota College Math, Science, and Technology Department](https://www.olc.edu/current-students/degree-programs-areas-of-study/math-science-tech/),
which has included a collaboration on Tribal boundary maps, gathered in the
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package
[landmapr](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/landmapr).

I attended the
[CU Boulder EarthLab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/) course
on [Earth Data Analytics](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/EarthDataAnalytics).
To help me understand and organize code and ideas, I developed the
[landmapy](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/landmapy) package.
My notes on [Python](https://www.python.org/) and related topics developed during the course are in
[Python References](python_references.md),
[Python Coding Strategy](python_strategy.md),
and
[Environmental Systems References](envsys.md),
now gathered in this repository.

My notes on [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) were organized in the
[geyser](https://github.com/byandell/geyser) repository
to help me consolidate my understanding of `Shiny` in `R` and `Python`.
My learning about AI agents and tools is evolving, including the repository
[sysgenAnalysis](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/sysgenAnalysis)
I have been working in System Genetics for several decades, with material
gathered in the GitHub Organization
[byandell-sysgen](https://github.com/byandell-sysgen).
